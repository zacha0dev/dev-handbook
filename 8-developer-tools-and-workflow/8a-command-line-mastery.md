# 8A - Command Line Mastery

The **command line (CLI)** is every developer’s essential toolkit.  
It gives you full control over your system - faster and more precise than any GUI.

---

### 1. Why Use the Command Line?

- Automate repetitive tasks  
- Navigate folders quickly  
- Run and debug scripts  
- Manage environments and packages

---

### 2. Common Commands (Windows / macOS / Linux)

| Action | Windows | macOS/Linux |
|--------|----------|--------------|
| Show current folder | `cd` | `pwd` |
| List files | `dir` | `ls -la` |
| Change directory | `cd folder` | `cd folder` |
| Make directory | `mkdir new_folder` | `mkdir new_folder` |
| Remove file/folder | `del file.txt` | `rm file.txt` / `rm -rf folder` |
| Copy file | `copy a.txt b.txt` | `cp a.txt b.txt` |

---

### 3. Python From the CLI

```bash
python hello.py
python -m venv .venv
pip install requests
```

You can even launch interactive mode:
```bash
python
>>> print("Hello CLI!")
```

---

### 4. Power Moves

- Use **Tab** for autocomplete  
- Use **↑ / ↓ arrows** to recall commands  
- Chain commands: `cd folder && python app.py`  
- Redirect output: `python app.py > log.txt`  

---

### 5. Key Takeaways
- Learn at least 10 commands by heart.  
- Automate small tasks daily.  
- The CLI is your best friend for speed and automation.
