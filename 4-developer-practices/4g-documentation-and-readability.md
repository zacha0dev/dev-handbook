# 4G - Documentation and Readability

Readable code is maintainable code.  
Documentation ensures you - and others - understand what each part does.

---

### 1. Comments and Docstrings

```python
# This function adds two numbers
def add(x, y):
    """Return the sum of x and y."""
    return x + y
```

Use comments for *why*, not *what*.

---

### 2. Naming and Style

- Use clear variable names: `user_age` > `ua`  
- Follow [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) style guide.  
- Keep functions short and focused.

---

### 3. README and Markdown Docs

Include a `README.md` explaining:
- What your project does  
- How to install and run it  
- Example commands or screenshots

---

### 4. Key Takeaways
- Write code as if someone else will read it.  
- Use docstrings for functions.  
- Maintain a project README for clarity.
