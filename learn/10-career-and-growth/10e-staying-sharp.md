| **10%** | Formal study (books, courses) |

### 2. Keep Up Without Burning Out

- Follow a few trusted blogs, not hundreds.  
- Block out weekly “learning hours.”  
- Focus on *depth*, not just trends.  
- Take real breaks - rest improves retention.

Stay curious, build small things, and focus on *progress*, not perfection.
