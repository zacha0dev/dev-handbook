# 10A - Learning How to Learn

Becoming a great developer isn’t about memorizing syntax - it’s about **learning effectively**.  
Once you understand how to learn, every new language or tool becomes easier.

### 1. The Learning Loop

1. **Understand** - read or watch to grasp the concept.  
2. **Apply** - code it, break it, fix it.  
3. **Reflect** - summarize in your own words.  
4. **Share** - teach or document what you learned.  

> Teaching is the highest form of understanding.

### 2. Active Learning > Passive Learning

| Passive | Active |
|----------|---------|
| Watching tutorials | Writing your own examples |
| Reading blogs | Building projects |
| Copying code | Explaining how it works |

### 3. Use Spaced Repetition

Revisit hard topics multiple times.  
You don’t need long study sessions - just **consistent exposure**.

Example workflow:
- Monday → learn lists  
- Wednesday → use lists in a mini-project  
- Friday → explain lists to a friend

### 4. The “Rubber Duck” Method

Explain your problem out loud, even to an object on your desk.  
Most times, the act of explaining helps you see the solution.

### 5. Key Takeaways
- Learn by **doing and explaining**.  
- Focus on small, consistent steps.  
- Reflection solidifies long-term memory.
