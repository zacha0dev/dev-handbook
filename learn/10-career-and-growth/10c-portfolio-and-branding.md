### 1. The Developer Portfolio

Your portfolio = your resume in motion.  
Include these key parts:

| Section | Example |
|----------|----------|
| **Intro** | Who you are and what you build |
| **Projects** | 2–3 strong examples with descriptions |
| **Skills** | Tools and technologies you use |
| **Contact** | Easy way to reach you (email, LinkedIn) |

### 2. Projects That Stand Out

1. Solve a real problem you had.  
2. Show your thought process - diagrams, notes, screenshots.  
3. Host your code publicly (GitHub).  
4. Add a short demo video or GIF.
