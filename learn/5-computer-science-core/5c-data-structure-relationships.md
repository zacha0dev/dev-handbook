# 5C - Data Structure Relationships

Data structures are the **foundation of algorithms**.  
They determine how information is stored, accessed, and modified.

### 1. The Core Categories

| Category | Structures | Description |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Linear** | Arrays, Lists, Queues, Stacks | Items arranged in order |
| **Hierarchical** | Trees, Heaps, Tries | Parent–child relationships |
| **Networked** | Graphs | Nodes connected by links |
| **Associative** | Hash Maps / Dicts | Key-value lookup |

---

### 2. How They Connect

- Arrays power **lists**.  
- Linked lists power **queues** and **stacks**.  
- Trees evolve into **heaps** and **tries**.  
- Graphs generalize trees.  
- Hash maps back many real-world databases.

### 3. Visualization
```
List → Queue → Stack → Tree → Graph
     ↘ Dict → Database
```

Each level increases structure and specialization.

### 4. Key Takeaways
- All data structures relate to each other.  
- Pick based on access speed, order, and flexibility.  
- Trees and graphs power most modern systems.
