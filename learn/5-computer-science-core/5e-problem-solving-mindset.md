# 5E - Problem-Solving Mindset

Programming is as much about **thinking** as it is about typing code.  
Good developers approach problems systematically.

---

### 1. The Problem-Solving Loop

1. **Understand the problem.** What’s being asked?  
2. **Break it down.** Identify smaller parts.  
3. **Plan a solution.** Write pseudocode.  
4. **Implement step by step.** Don’t rush.  
5. **Test and refine.** Fix small issues early.

### 2. Pseudocode Example

Before writing real code, sketch it out.

```
START
  ask for user's name
  if name is not empty:
      print greeting
  else:
      print "Try again"
END
```

Then code it:

```python
name = input("Enter your name: ")
if name:
    print("Hello,", name)
else:
    print("Try again")
```

### 3. Thinking in Patterns

Look for patterns in problems:
- Is it counting, searching, sorting, or mapping?  
- Can you reuse a structure or function?  
- Can it be simplified by reordering steps?

### 4. Key Takeaways
- Think before you code.  
- Solve small problems first.  
- Always analyze and test incrementally.  
- Clear thinking creates clean code.
